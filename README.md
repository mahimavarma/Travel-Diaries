# traveldiary  
Project Demo:-  
1. The user tries to log in without registering so the error message is shown 'Email not found'
2. While registering the user puts 'password' and 'confirm password' differently hence it gives the error 'password Mismatch'
3. After registering the account on the sign-in page if we put the password incorrectly it gives the error 'incorrect password'
4. After putting in the correct password we finally land on our main page where the user can choose their preference of where they want to travel.
5. Once the preference is chosen we suggest them 3 top attractions based on their preference and they can look at the details, location, and activities available there.
6. There is also a page dedicated to the hotel accommodations nearby for tourists to find a place to stay.
